            <p> The War Bonnet Round Up is Idaho's Oldest Rodeo. Today, more than 450 cowboys and cowgirls compete each summer in front of more than 15,000 rodeo enthusiasts. The Round Up was originally started in 1911 by a group of local businessman and then was later taken over by the Chamber of Commerce. Eventually, the American Legion Department of Idaho Post 56 nonprofit veteran's organization took over the reins. Over the years, the rodeo has been held at various locations including Tautphaus Park and is now held at Sandy Downs Arena, a city-owned facility. The Legion grew the widely popular event into the show it is today and for that we are forever grateful.</p>
            <p> This year marks another year the City of Idaho Falls and the Parks and Recreation Department has run this historic rodeo, and we are honored to welcome back the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of Fort Hall. From the beginning, the tribes provided the most colorful component of the rodeo, making the War Bonnet Round Up an important part of eastern Idaho's culture and tradition. We are very passionate about maintaining and building upon this legacy.</p>
