        <div class="faqContainer">
            <p><strong>What Security Procedures will be present at this event?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>At the War Bonnet Round Up, we will have dozens of highly trained security guards and employees on hand to help out with any possible issues. At the front gate, a trained guard will be on hand to help with any security issues when entering or exiting.</p>

        <div class="faqContainer">
            <p><strong>Can I reserve my seats?</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Seats at the War Bonnet are on a “first come, first served” basis. That means that if you arrive late to the rodeo, even if you have a ticket, there might be standing room only. Furthermore, you are not allowed to arrive early to the event and “reserve” seats for people arriving a few hours later. If you need a seat, you must either buy a VIP table or arrive earlier in the event.</p>

        <div class="faqContainer">
            <p><strong>Can I bring in my own Food and Drinks?</strong></p>

            <p>We do not allow in food or drinks to the Round Up. Sealed clear water bottles, or snacks needed due to an illness or disease, are allowed. These items must be inspected by the guard at the entrance.</p>
