            <p>General Admission Rodeo Tickets are sold both online and at physical stores. We highly recommend you buy ahead of time before tickets sell out! </p>
            <br>
            <p>General Admission tickets will allow you to enter the rodeo grounds. They do <strong>NOT</strong> guarantee you seats! If you want the best seats, you will have to arrive early. The ticket also does not include the parking fee.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When you arrive at the arena, make sure you have the physical tickets with you, either the hard copy of the tickets, a printed out copy of your tickets, or the tickets available to pull up on your phone.</p>
            <br>
