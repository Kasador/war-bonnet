            <p class="volPara">The War Bonnet Round Up is only possible thanks to our wonderful Ranch Hand volunteers. Every year, hundreds of people come together to volunteer their time to help this event. We are always looking for help with ticket checkers, hand stampers, cleanup crew, drink pouring, and other important positions! Whether you are an individual looking to help out, a company looking for an exciting way to give back to the community, or an Eagle Scout looking for a project, we are happy to have the help! Our volunteers are treated very well, and in exchange for their time, they can receive comped meals, free rodeo tickets, rodeo shirts, and other awesome items. Please reach out to Mason Handke, Volunteer Coordinator, to apply to be a volunteer TODAY!</p>
